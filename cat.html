               <!-- <p>The cat <b>(Felis catus)</b> is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the <b>domestic cat</b> or <b>house cat</b> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>
               <p>The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.</p>
               <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.</p> -->

               <p>Cats are a very popular group of land mammals within the suborder Feliformia, which includes anything from lions to domestic cats. Cats are often furry, and always carnivorous, animals. They are found all over the world--with the larger species of the suborder found primarily in Africa, southern Asia, and south-east Asia. All cats, no matter the size or climate, are known for their retractable claws, speedy reflexes, and pointy teeth used to slice tough meat!
               Cats are most commonly known for being kept as house pets. However, not all cats can be kept as house pets. Only those cats referred to as domestic cats are suitable. In other words, they are called domestic cats because they have been domesticated, which means they can live in harmony with humans. They are great companions because of their cuddly nature and soft, calming purr.</p>
